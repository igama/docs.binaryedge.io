# Sinkhole Data

Sinkhole event data is generated by our "listen-only" machines, which simply listen and store all data payloads that are sent to them. These payloads will many times refer to what other scanners are probing.

**Currently only available for Enterprise, via Data Stream**

## Schema

```json
{
   "origin":{
      "ip":"string",
      "port":"int",
      "asn":"int",
      "rdns":"string",
      "rdns_parent":"string",
      "type":"string",
      "client_id":"string",
      "ts":"int"
   },
   "target":{
      "ip":"string",
      "port":"int",
      "protocol":"string"
   },
   "data":{
      "payload":"string",
      "extra":"object",
      "tags":"list"
   }
}
```

### Contents of the fields:

* **origin**: Information about the origin of the payload, i.e, source remote machine that sent the payload
    * **ip**: IP address of the source of the payload
    * **port**: Port of the source of the payload
    * **asn**: AS number associated with the source IP address
    * **rdns**: Reverse DNS of the source IP address
    * **type**: Static field, always "sinkhole", meant to distinguish from other events
    * **client_id**: Static field, always "sinkhole", meant to distinguish from other events
    * **ts**: Timestamp of when the payload was sent

* **target**: Information about the target of the payload, i.e, our machine that received the payload
    * **ip**: IP address of the destination of the payload
    * **port**: Port of the destination of the payload
    * **protocol**: Protocol of the destination of the payload (currently TCP only)

* **data**: Information about the payload
    **payload**: Raw data that was sent and captured. No additional processing.
    **extra**: Data extracted after partially processing the payload.
    **tags**: Rule based tagging derived from the payload.

         }
      },
      "tags": ["SSH_SCANNER"]
   }
}
